# Style Guide Quick Start

## 3 Steps to Use Style Guides

### 1. Choose Your Method

**Option A: Use an Example (Fastest)**
```bash
# Copy content from one of these files:
- example_style_guide.txt (general fiction)
- erotica_style_guide.txt (romance/NSFW)
- action_thriller_style_guide.txt (action/suspense)
```

**Option B: Create Custom (Most Control)**
Write your own focusing on:
- Voice & tone
- Sentence structure
- Dialogue style
- Pacing preferences
- Show vs tell approach

**Option C: Minimal Quick Guide**
Just write 3-5 bullet points of your top priorities:
```
- Close third-person POV, stay in character's head
- Short sentences for action, longer for emotion
- Use action beats instead of dialogue tags
- Emphasize sensory details (especially smell/touch)
- Dark, atmospheric tone
```

### 2. Load in Web UI

1. Go to **🎯 Step-by-Step** page
2. Expand **📝 Prose Style Guide (Optional)**
3. Either:
   - Paste text directly into the text area, OR
   - Upload a `.txt`/`.md` file

### 3. Generate Prose

2. Your style guide will be applied to all beats
3. Review results and adjust style guide if needed

## Testing Your Style Guide

Generate 2-3 beats, then check:
- ✅ Is the voice/tone what you wanted?
- ✅ Is dialogue natural and character-specific?
- ✅ Is pacing appropriate for scene type?
- ✅ Are your top 3 rules being followed?

If not, refine and try again. Be more specific about what you want.

## Pro Tips

1. **Start simple** - 3-5 clear rules beats 20 vague ones
2. **Be specific** - "Use action beats instead of said" > "Write good dialogue"
3. **Show examples** - "Like this / Not like this" helps AI understand
4. **Iterate** - Refine after seeing results
5. **Save your guide** - Reuse successful style guides across projects
