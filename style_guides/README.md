## Tips for Effective Style Guides

### Be Specific
- ‚ùå "Write good dialogue"
- ‚úÖ "Use action beats instead of dialogue tags. Each character should have distinct speech patterns reflecting their background."

### Provide Examples
- Show what you want and what to avoid
- Include specific phrases or techniques

### Focus on Your Priorities
- Don't try to control everything
- Highlight 5-10 most important style elements
- Let the AI handle the rest

### Balance Freedom and Control
- Give guidelines, not rigid rules
- Allow room for creativity
- Focus on "prefer X" rather than "never Y"

### Test and Iterate
- Generate a few beats with your style guide
- Refine based on results
- Different scenes may need different emphasis

## Advanced: Context-Specific Style Guides

You can modify your style guide based on:
- **Genre blend**: Romance-thriller gets different treatment than pure romance
- **POV character**: Each character's sections might have unique voice
- **Book in series**: Later books might have different tone
- **Scene type**: Action vs emotional vs mystery scenes

## Integration with Pipeline

The style guide is:
1. **Prepended** to each beat's context with clear delimiters
2. **Processed** by the LLM alongside beat description, character actions, dialogue summary
3. **Applied consistently** across all beats in your prose generation run
4. **Preserved** in session state until you change it

## Troubleshooting

**Style guide not being followed?**
- Make instructions more specific
- Check for conflicting guidelines
- Ensure beat descriptions don't contradict style guide
- Try shorter, clearer instructions

**Prose too similar/repetitive?**
- Allow more creative freedom in style guide
- Focus on tone/voice rather than specific techniques
- Vary beat descriptions to encourage variety

**Style guide too restrictive?**
- Reduce number of rules
- Use "prefer" language instead of "must/never"
- Focus on highest-priority elements only

## Style Guide Storage

- **Session**: Stored in Streamlit session state (temporary)
- **File**: Save/load from `.txt` or `.md` files
- **Project**: Not currently stored with project JSON (manual load each session)

To persist across sessions, save your style guide file and reload it when starting a new session.
