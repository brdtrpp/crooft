# Action/Thriller Style Guide

## Voice & Tone
- Maintain urgency and tension throughout
- Use tight, economical prose - every word counts
- Keep reader breathless with forward momentum
- Build dread and suspense even in quiet moments

## Sentence Structure for Action
- Short, punchy sentences during action sequences
- Fragments for impact: "Gun raised. Three shots. Two bodies."
- Active voice always - eliminate passive constructions
- One action per sentence for clarity during chaos

## Pacing
- Action scenes: Rapid-fire, minimal description, pure movement
- Breathing room: Brief moments for character reaction between action
- Build tension: Slow down just before explosive moments
- No info dumps during action - exposition comes in quiet moments

## Action Choreography
- Be specific about physical movements and spatial relationships
- Track positions of characters and objects clearly
- Use environmental details as obstacles or advantages
- Show cause and effect: bullet hits wall, sends debris flying

## Sensory Details in Action
- Emphasize sound: gunshots, breaking glass, screaming
- Physical sensations: impact, pain, adrenaline
- Smell: gunpowder, blood, smoke
- Sight: muzzle flash, shadows, quick movements
- Minimize introspection during action - raw reactions only

## Dialogue
- Keep it brief and punchy
- Characters speak in fragments under stress
- Show urgency through interruptions and incomplete sentences
- Use silence and action beats instead of long exchanges

## Suspense & Tension
- Use ticking clocks and deadlines
- Layer multiple threats simultaneously
- Show competent opponents - heroes should struggle
- Include setbacks and complications constantly
- End scenes/chapters on cliffhangers or revelations

## POV During Action
- Stay tight in POV character's experience
- Limited awareness - they don't see everything
- Include confusion and uncertainty
- Show physical limitations and exhaustion

## Stakes
- Make consequences clear and immediate
- Personal stakes alongside larger threats
- Show what character stands to lose
- Raise stakes progressively

## Avoid
- Long descriptive passages during action
- Complex sentence structures in fight scenes
- Character stops to think/remember during danger
- Unrealistic action sequences - ground in physics
- Repetitive action beats
- Deus ex machina rescues

## Fight Scenes
- Describe specific moves, not general "fighting"
- Show damage accumulating
- Include environment in combat
- Characters get tired, hurt, make mistakes
- End fights decisively
