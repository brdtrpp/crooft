## Voice & Tone
- Maintain an intimate, sensual tone throughout
- Balance explicit content with emotional connection
- Use close POV to emphasize internal sensations and reactions
- Build tension through anticipation and desire

## Sensory Details (Critical for Erotica)
- Emphasize physical sensations: touch, taste, heat, pressure
- Include specific body responses: quickening pulse, flushed skin, trembling
- Layer sensory details - combine physical sensations with emotional responses
- Use temperature and texture descriptions liberally

## Pacing & Build-up
- Slow build-up for tension - don't rush to explicit scenes
- Vary intensity: tease, escalate, pause for emotion, escalate again
- Mix explicit scenes with character development and plot
- Use anticipation and denial to maintain tension

## Explicit Content Guidelines

## Dialogue During Intimate Scenes
- Keep dialogue natural and character-appropriate
- Use dirty talk that matches character personality
- Include non-verbal communication: gasps, moans, body language
- Show desire through subtext and implication before explicit moments

## Emotional Connection

- Show vulnerability, trust, or power dynamics
- Include internal monologue about desire, fear, or connection
- Balance physical description with emotional response

## Character Voice in Intimate Scenes
