# Prose Style Guide Example

## Voice & Tone
- Write in close third-person POV, deeply embedded in the POV character's perspective
- Use present tense for immediate action, past tense for narrative
- Maintain an intimate, immersive tone that draws readers into the character's experience

## Sentence Structure
- Vary sentence length for rhythm: short sentences for tension/action, longer for introspection
- Use fragments sparingly for emphasis or character voice
- Avoid purple prose - clarity over flowery language

## Dialogue
- Make dialogue sound natural and character-specific
- Use action beats instead of dialogue tags when possible
- Show subtext - characters don't always say what they mean
- Avoid "on the nose" exposition dumps in conversation
- Each character should have a distinct voice

## Show, Don't Tell
- Replace telling with sensory details and character reactions
- Instead of "she was angry" → "her jaw clenched, heat flooding her cheeks"
- Use body language, environmental details, and internal sensations

## Sensory Details
- Include at least 2-3 senses per beat (not just sight)
- Ground every scene in physical space
- Use sensory details that reveal character emotion/state

## Pacing
- Action scenes: Short paragraphs, active verbs, minimal description
- Emotional scenes: Allow space for introspection, slower pacing
- Dialogue scenes: Mix dialogue with action beats and brief internal thoughts

## POV Discipline
- Filter ALL descriptions through the POV character's perception
- Never describe what another character thinks/feels unless POV character observes it
- Use the POV character's vocabulary and worldview

## Avoid
- Adverbs in dialogue tags (said quickly, whispered softly, etc.)
- Clichés and overused phrases
- Info dumps - weave exposition naturally
- Head-hopping - stay in one POV per scene
- Passive voice unless intentionally used for effect
