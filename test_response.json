'What about kinetic or sensory elements?' she inquired, her mind already spinning with possibilities. 'In past exchanges with guests who prioritized emotional connection, we incorporated things like warm lighting, soft textures, and soothing scents. Are there any specific touches like that we could include to enhance his experience?'\n\nLian nodded thoughtfully. 'Great point, Kira. The pre-screening data indicates he responds well to gentle, nurturing touch. Perhaps we could incorporate some plush fabrics and weighted blankets to create a sense of security and comfort.'\n\nArden smiled, her eyes sparkling with warmth. 'I love that idea. And maybe we could use the ship's environmental controls to infuse the space with a subtle, calming scent, like lavender or sandalwood.'\n\nKira's lips curved into a satisfied smile. 'Perfect. I'll make a note in the Negotiated Scene Plan to have those elements ready. With those sensory details layered in, I think we'll be able to craft an incredibly intimate and emotionally fulfilling experience for our guest.'",
